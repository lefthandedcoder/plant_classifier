This is the final capstone project for the WGU computer science program. 
This application can classify 35 different types of edible plants commonly found in the wild based on uploaded images.
The application is built using Python 3.7 and Google Colab with an open source dataset retrieved from www.kaggle.com.
Future versions of this application may include a mobile version and region-specific plant classifications.
Trained to 91.67% accuracy with 15,000+ images across 35 categories
Designed and implemented using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras with PyCharm, Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, and Git version control. Deployed with Flask and Heroku.
