This is the final capstone project for my bachelor of science degree in computer science. 
This application can classify 35 different types of edible plants commonly found in the wild based on uploaded images.
The application is built using Python 3.7 and Google Colab with an open source dataset retrieved from www.kaggle.com.
Future versions of this application may include a mobile version and region-specific plant classifications.
